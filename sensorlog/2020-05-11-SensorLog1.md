- MCP3421 adc: control via i2c

- TM1618 LCD driver, 4 digit 8 segment SPI driven

  **important** need 共阴

  chinese name for LCD is 数码管

- AVR: 32u4, or any AVR since v-usb

  but doesn't seem like there are any good non-usb AVR chips, I'd rather just
  get a 32u4, and in that case I'd rather get STM32F103

- STM32L053C6 (has LCD) or LPC11(U13) for USB

  but very big and expensive and annoying to solder

- PIC16LF1454 has USB included, doesn't waste any peripherals since there's very
  little, is cheap (but not sure how to obtain it yet) (maybe taobao???? mouser
  no self collect)

  only problem is potential future additions and unfamiliarity in programming
  (but PIC is well supported so ??)

  but need soft SPI bit banging for LCD driver since SPI and I2C share bus

- ATSAMD11D14A has SPI, I2C, SWD, USB in SOIC20 pkg

  is low power as well because M0+ core

  but one potential problem is using microchip's programming IDE, seems bad

  but but since it's ARM we can use openOCD also

  but another problem is not easily available

- stm32f0(70/42) seems good since easily available

  but would have to forgo ext oscillator to have i2c with external ADC, so only
  f042 works

- for now use stm32f103c8 since we are used to it and there are some in lab.

- we need 0.2, 2, 20V; 0.02, 0.2/0.5, 10A; thermistor

- for current measurement, 10A, we need 0.01 or 0.005 ohm so that power draw is
  (relatively) low at <1W

  PGA of ADC would need to be 8, eg impedance will be ~280k ohm (only)

- for mA range, ~1.5 ohm with PGA=2

  impedance will be ~1M ohm, power draw is <0.4W, burden voltage is ~0.9V
  (because of PTC fuse)

  PTC fuse will be ~0.3 ohm, so shunt may need to have higher resistance

- for measuring resistance, would either need 2 ADC to measure voltage of power
  source and run the test resistance through voltage divider, or have a current
  source and just measure voltage across test resistance.

  2 ADC seems impractical, since it's just for the sole purpose of resistance
  testing, [current source](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sbva001/sbva001.pdf) seems
  simple and the way to go.

  since this needs voltage reference + op amp, chinese names:

  - voltage reference: 电压基准

    LM336 looks like a good cheap option

    alternatively the fancy REF30xx are small but very slightly more expensive
    (cents), but probably way more accurate and they don't require calibration,
    so ??

  - op-amp: 运算放大器

    LM358 seems like the "standard" op-amp for everyone, there's 5 variants in
    the top 9 sold op-amps. 2-channel. max V on non-inverting is V-2, so it's
    not rail to rail, but we don't really need that anyways
