- latching wouldn't work since the current input jacks are not referenced to
  battery ground, and it would be dangerous to reference it, we need it to be as
  isolated as possible.

  Will probably just do MCU side MOSFET off thing

- can't really use MOSFETS/BJT to turn off in general since this is
  bi-directional, whereas transistors need a "reference" to ground, eg Vgs, Vbe

  because of this can't use opto isolators as well since most are made from BJTs

- There are triac opto isolators, which are supposed to switch AC so it is
  bi-directional, but it won't work for DC since there is no zero-crossing so
  it'll stay permanently on

- Using gate turn-off thyristor looks like a potential option but it is mostly
  used for high poered applications and there are little in small packages

- Bi-directional power switch made with 2 MOSFETs looks good, but the diode
  forward voltage applies here, so there will be huge power losses

- Ultimately fuse or relay looks to be the best option, but there are no
  resettable fuse above 5A and relay is scary for higher voltage applications.

- Seems like I was wrong on the bps, diode has no effect here. Main reason why
  this works is common source is referenced to something and not floating. Not
  sure how this will affect the circuit since it connects the input to internal
  circuitry but will need to test irl to know for sure.

  Should still put a fuse for safety though

- From [TI's appnote](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva948/slva948.pdf), we can put
  a zener between common gate and source to set up constant Vgs

  Since on INA219 higher Vshunt = higher res, maybe I should have 3 different
  shunt values, one for 10A, one for 5A, one for 500mA

- binding post is 接线柱

- fusion electronics is still occasionally buggy, switching back to EAGLE for
  now, but KICAD looks really interesting esp the thing about separate schematic
  symbol from footprint

  not sure whether it'll end up useful that I can start on schematic before I
  pick out exact components, or whether it'll be annoying to keep remapping ICs
  and stuff (not sure whether I have to do that in the first place) maybe I'll
  try it sometime later

- can consider using ~0.2 ohms for one of the current ranges since we alr have
  it in lab
