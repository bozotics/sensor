- In the op-amp datasheet there is instructions against overvoltage protection
  on inputs, will use a 1N4148WS diode from non-inverting input to Vdd.

- Will use a SGM3002 (2x SPDT MUX), INA199A1 (50V/V gain), 74LVC1G04 (Inverter)

- Won't use the REF on the INA199 since I already referenced the COM to 1.65v
