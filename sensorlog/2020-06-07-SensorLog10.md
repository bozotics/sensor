# 7 June

- Whelps finished homework (for now), so back to this after 2 weeks!

- Going back to researching op-amps and it seems like this may not be as easy as
  once thought: at low full scale voltage ranges, the input impedance is lower,
  but it's at lower voltages that noise (from op-amp) will affect it more so...

- New ADCs suddenly popped up on taobao apparently, but none of them really fit
  what we need

- There's one seemingly good analog devices one, quite ex but it offers 4
  pseudo-differential channels, but it looks really complex and I want to keep
  our BOM as simple as possible so probably not

- From TI op-amp follower + ADC AppNote
  ([SLOA098](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa098/sloa098.pdf)) the circuits all
  seem needlessly complicated like I just tested a simple follower circuit in
  CircuitJS and the follower circuit can output both positive and negative
  voltages so...?

- okay nope so CircuitJS was just really simplified, the standard LM358 can
  output negative voltage but only if the supply V- is also negative.. currently
  looking at specialised buffer amplifier ICs because some of them have
  differential outputs

- Specialised buffer amplifier ICs are really really ex (~\$3 was the cheapest
  on e14) and they are usually not unity gain since they exist to buffer +
  amplify video signals so that's out of the question...

- On Taobao (KeZhan) there is a op-amp which seems (states it outright on
  datasheet) unity gain stable and it's really cheap, but it only supports
  single supply and +ve voltage output... rip (edit: actually it's available on
  youxin also)

  On Taobao again (Steadily) there is another op-amp AD8671 which is unity gain
  stable, it only supports dual supply but because of that it can output -ve
  voltage, but it's relatively ex compared to say LM358 (7 yuan vs >1yuan)
  (edit: actually it's available on youxin also)

- seems like that's the way to go already tho, not sure whether it's even
  possible for the op-amp to output negative voltages without dual supply. One
  way may be to just look for an analog devices op-amp which already has a high
  input impedance, at the rate that these high precision atas op-amps cost the
  total BOM cost will probably end up the same anyways... only problem now is
  these atas op-amps have so many pins idk what they do ugh

- ugh time for an ADC showdown again

  |            | ADS1118 | < + op-amp | ADS1232 | AD7799 | AD7190 | AD7706 |
  | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
  | Price (Â¥)  | 10      | 20         | 10      | 20     | 30     | 20?    |
  | Impedance? | bad     | good       | good    | good   | good   | good   |
  | Channels   | 3 (p)   | 3 (p)      | 2       | 3      | 4 (p)  | 3 (p)  |
  | easy use   | 5       | 1          | 2       | 4      | 2      | 5      |

  Seems like the obvious choice would be AD7799, because of low price (it seems
  like _the_ atas ADC on taobao), no weird random pinouts making it easy to use,
  and 3 channels, but it's pretty dumb since those 3 channels are not pseudo
  channels. Technically it doesn't matter, but it just feels dumb...

  AD7706 comes next then, but it isn't very available on Taobao, and the AD7705
  which is readily available doesn't have pseudo diff inputs so I'd rather just
  get AD7799

  So maybe I'll use the AD7190...? It seems very good ~~except my BOM going to
  be huge~~ nope I was wrong, so the external clock and REF seem optional,
  **BUT** damnit the A-Vdd requires 5v ugh I was rooting for this
