# 9 June

- Okay I was absolutely lost about the input not being able to go below ground
  thing, and I went to reference the micro progmeter logs and schematics again.
  Turns out, he mentioned in one of his
  [logs](https://hackaday.io/project/7988/log/28964-adc-input-problems-again)
  about his grounding issues, and how he had to offset these voltages through
  some resistor network.

  Taking a closer look at his schematics, I realised the common input jack was
  actually tied to AVss! (In the end to offset the voltage he put a resistor but
  it's close enough) so the AVss was actually connected to digital ground... hmm
  but the AD7792 doesn't have a separate analog gnd so I'll probably have to
  look back to other ADCs.

- Okay hold up a voltage "bias" or "offset" on the common jack is essentially
  constructing a "virtual ground", so actually I can revert to my original plan
  of ADS1118 + Op Amp, but this time I don't need to make a virtual ground for
  the op amp, I can just make a virtual ground at the input!

  Small issues rn are

  - The OPA633 "dedicated" buffer IC ~~only works with dual supply it seems, so
    maybe I'll need to make the virtual ground at the buffer rather than the
    input~~ Nevermind it works with minimum 5v so it's out
  - Other Op-Amps may not be able to output close enough to the rails, and after
    splitting my full scale voltage in half I still have to account for the
    output limits that's a little tricky

- Okay went back in the logs to find that MCP6004 is quite good for this use
  case:

  - quite cheap
  - available on youxin so I can buy everything from one place
  - unity gain stable
  - ~3v can power it
  - quad op-amps so I can use it for current source and other things
  - rail to rail

  Alternatively youxin sells a more atas OPA2350/OPA2171 which is also unity
  gain stable and is dual op-amp so if I don't need op-amps for anything other
  than 1 buffer + current source maybe I can use that

  OR youxin also sells the dual op-amp MCP6002 so maybe that works too

- Reading more about creating a "virtual ground", seems like there are a lot of
  considerations and using a TLE2426 looks like the best option but in this case
  resistors alone should work since we're not aiming to work with AC (?)

- Okay I have no clue what the TI AppNote about buffer op amps is doing, so I'm
  just going to ignore it and hope for the best. Circuit should be quite easy to
  come up with now for the basic stage, need to start thinking about excitation
  current source (for resistances) and also current shunts.

- In the future it would be preferred if we can use the ADS1147 instead, since
  it exposes more "settings" like VRef and it includes a current excitation
  source so it's like an all in one solution which would likely be more accurate
  as we don't need a separate op-amp buffer.

- Okay currently looking at current sources (again) and through Falstad Circuit
  Sim I found this new current source (as opposed to the old VRef one) which is
  called Howland Current Pump and it forgoes the VRef and just uses an op-amp,
  but there's a whole TI AppNote about the potential pitfalls so lol hope this
  doesn't get too complex
