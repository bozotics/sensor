- PGA characteristics of INA219 very interesting, with a lower gain (/8) the
  "resolution" can increase since it increases the gain to find out the least
  significant bit (eg the last few decimal places)

  [link to article](http://cdwilson.us/articles/understanding-the-INA219/)

- did writeup so not much here woop

- tried to do a reverse soft latch switch, eg when MCU turns ON, then the switch
  turns OFF, but still struggling to figure it out since after it turns OFF
  theres no more power at the OUT side, maybe split "rails"?

  Anyways this is just turning off for the input side, not the power, so shld be
  fine
