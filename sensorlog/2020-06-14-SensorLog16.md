- Finally figured out the TM1618, the Key input pins are just multiplexed inputs
  which send values via DI/O, that's why without keys the data pin is only an
  input! Will just leave the keys pins floating, and DI/O into MOSI.

- use this sp3t
  [switch](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c-s.w4002-21223910208.21.477e6a4bA4vr07&id=557092773462)

- ~~use this 0.8mm embedded 6p
  [usb-c](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c-s.w4002-21223910208.12.55dd6a4brLysCc&id=591212737540)~~

  Nope can't use that, according to
  [this eevBlog forum](<https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/type-c-in-micro-usb-footprint-(female-connectors)/>)
  D+ and D- aren't part of the 6 pins. Will just use micro usb instead.

- and yay I'm done with schematic
