# 11 June

- Just realised I should probably not get a 2:1 MUX, I'll probably need to
  switch between current and voltage ranges also so maybe I'll look at 3P2T MUX.

- Since I no longer need current source, probably can just use 1 channel op-amp.
  Youxin has the MCP6001, 1 channel version of what I originally wanted to use.

  Taking the op-amp output as ±0.1v away from the rails, FSR input to op-amp is
  ±1.55v. Will use resistor dividers of 10M and 820k for full scale of ±20V.
  Probably would need another range, will do that tomorrow along with 2
  resistance ranges.
