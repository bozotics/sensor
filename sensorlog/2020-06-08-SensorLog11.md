- Within Analog Device's catalog there doesn't seem to be anything more suitable
  than an AD7706, but that's difficult to find on taobao and not available on
  e14 and somehow more expensive than an AD7799/AD7792?

- So currently looking at ADS1120 (the ADC that micro progmeter on hackaday
  used) and it seems pretty good (explains why they used it) however it is
  really expensive on e14 and there aren't well known sellers on Taobao.

- Continuing on with TI range of ADCs, there is this ADS1147 which is 4-ch and
  has an internal excitation current source which will be so so useful and
  scales down our BOM by so so much, if we can get that then a lot of my issues
  are solve. But good things never happen to me: It is \$15sgd on e14, and it
  requires negative supply voltage so I would need to add another rail splitter
  IC so that defeats the purpose of a small BOM

  okay but even though there aren't any well known sellers on Taobao, it's
  pretty cheap (~20Â¥) and it really decreases the complexity of my circuit very
  significantly so umm...

- Okay so I decided to take a look at the AD7792 and it has a internal
  excitation current source also!! since it's pretty cheap as well maybe I'll
  just go with it and connect all the AIN(-) pins together...

  okay upon reading further it seems the differential inputs is a little more
  complicated:

  > "A bipolar input range does not imply that the part can tolerate negative
  > voltages with respect to system GND." (From datasheet)

  Will have to read up a little more later, can't really think anymore for now

- Just realised we can't exactly use a 4 digit 7 segment LED since we can't put
  a negative sign, so would probably need to shift to an OLED... which usually
  (?) interfaces by I2C!! so I'll have to look at how to configure the STM32F070
  for I2C only and no SPI, great day
