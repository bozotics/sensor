- For follower op-amp, using the "standard" LM358 may be an issue since it's not
  rail to rail, the full scale voltage is only ~1v (3.3-2)

- seems like there are specific unity gain buffer ready op amps else they'll
  keep oscillating

- offset voltage may also be an issue

- also not sure how it's going to work with a diff ADC, some weird TI appnote
  describes it
