- seems like I got the characteristics of PTCs mixed up, the hold current should
  be exactly 500mA for the mA port since the trip current is at 1A so it won't
  actually trip immediately at 500mA.

  This also seems very sketchy, with a lower hold current the DC resistance
  increases, so now it ranges from 0.15-1 ohm for the larger package, and
  0.1-0.8 ohm for the
  [0603 package](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c-s.w4002-21223910208.15.46706a4bG8BLAg&id=560313507871)
  (which can handle less power)

- alternatively current measurement can be done with sensor, eg INA219 or ACS725
  or ACS712

  This allows for less input protection, less part count, lower burden voltage,
  no fuses needed!

  ACS725 is most preferred, eletrically isolated since it uses a hall sensor,
  however it's the most expensive

  ACS712 is same as ACS725 but with a 5v supply requirement, not sure how we are
  going to meet that with 1 cell battery, don't want to integrate boost circuits
  just for this.

- INA219 seems pretty good, no need for another ADC since it's integrated and
  outputs i2c, problem is the resolution maxes out at 12 bits, and compared to
  the above it's not electrically isolated (not that that is an issue,
  differential voltage measurement is >26V so)

  but it's not available on youxin, need to get from steadily

  but but the burden voltage will be very very small, with PGA set at /1 it's
  only 40mV.

- for input voltage protection at current side, can either use TVS diode or full
  bridge + 1 diode. According to lygte-info TVS won't protect from overheating,
  but ??? not sure why

  full bridge in chinese is 整流桥堆, seems pretty cheap but the forward voltage
  drop of DB107S is very ambiguous, in the datasheet it states "maximum [...]
  per bridge element" but what is a bridge element, is it a diode? then the
  voltage drop would seem pretty high at 1.1v / diode... but the other way round
  and it would seem way too low
