# 20 May

- Change ADC to the dual channel SPI (ADS1118), since we can share bus with the
  LCD controller. This can allow us to use the STM32F070F6P6, since the previous
  problem (11 May) was that the I2C bus cannot be used, now we don't need to use
  I2C.

- Seems like no one uses this chip even though it's dirt cheap on taobao (3-4
  yuan) so not sure how USB implementation will go, but there is free Keil MDK
  with the STM32F0 and Keil's USB MDK library thing seems to be quite well used
  and trustable.

  Apparently STM32 themselves also provide a USB device library within
  STM32CubeMX (User Manual UM1734) and this random library
  <http://www.emcu.it/STM32_USB/STM32_USB.pdf> so maybe it won't be TOO
  difficult after all. Even if there are issues with USB implementation, that
  isn't the primary thing to finish by July so it should be fine.

- ST themselves recommend the NRF51822 (appnote AN4499) and it's available on
  youxin for ~16 yuan, seems like the best cheap-enough BLE solution out there.

  they also have some JDY-32 but it seems sketchy not much support, will need to
  read more
