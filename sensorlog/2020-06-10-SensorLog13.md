- The Howland Current Pump wasn't that complex, but I was dumb and it still
  required a VRef. Only benefit over that TI AppNote solution was it can drive
  current both directions, but I think it doesn't really matter in this case.

- Currently simulating the TI/BurrBrown AppNote on falstad to determine what
  current ranges to use

  With a current source, the available resistances are limited to the op-amp
  output range, which is really bad since we're using a 3.3v voltage source and
  the output range is very limited. Maybe we should just forgo a current source
  and measure voltage across given resistor divider

- Okay probably going to follow micro progmeter method of measuring resistances,
  it even accounts for the voltage drop across a protection diode. I think the
  circuit is pretty much decided, just need to figure out the display and
  resistance ranges now. maybe 0-1k and 1k-100k should be enough?

  Since I want 2 ranges I'll need a MUX, but the MUX resistance shouldn't affect
  it at all if we're measuring both the reference resistor and the test
  resistor's voltages.
